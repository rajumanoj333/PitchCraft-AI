# Bug Fixes Summary

## Critical Bugs Fixed in PitchCraft Application

### 1. Backend Package Configuration Issues
**File:** `pitchcraft-ai/package.json`
- **Bug:** Main field pointed to `index.js` but actual server file was `server.js`
- **Fix:** Updated main field to `server.js` and added proper start scripts
- **Impact:** Server couldn't be started properly

### 2. Node.js Import Compatibility Issues
**File:** `pitchcraft-ai/package.json`
- **Bug:** Using `node-fetch@^3.3.2` with CommonJS, but v3+ is ESM-only
- **Fix:** Downgraded to `node-fetch@^2.7.0` for CommonJS compatibility
- **Impact:** Server would crash on startup due to import errors

### 3. Deprecated Supabase Auth API Usage
**Files:** 
- `pitchcraft-ai/server.js`
- `pitchcraft-ai/middleware/authMiddleware.js`  
- `pitchcraft-ai/services/supabaseService.js`
- **Bug:** Using deprecated methods:
  - `supabase.auth.api.getUser()` → should be `supabase.auth.getUser()`
  - `supabase.auth.signIn()` → should be `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword()`
  - `supabase.auth.signUp()` response structure changed
- **Fix:** Updated all auth methods to use current Supabase v2 API
- **Impact:** Authentication would fail completely

### 4. Frontend Supabase Auth API Issues
**Files:**
- `pitchcraft-frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`
- **Bug:** Using deprecated methods:
  - `supabase.auth.session()` → should be `supabase.auth.getSession()`
  - `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange()` return structure changed
- **Fix:** Updated to use async `getSession()` and proper subscription handling
- **Impact:** Frontend auth state management would fail

### 5. Missing Router Integration
**File:** `pitchcraft-ai/server.js`
- **Bug:** Server had organized route files but wasn't using them, duplicating route logic
- **Fix:** Integrated `apiRoutes.js` and `authRoutes.js` properly
- **Impact:** Poor code organization and potential route conflicts

### 6. Empty Controller Implementation
**File:** `pitchcraft-ai/controllers/pitchController.js`
- **Bug:** File was completely empty (0 bytes)
- **Fix:** Added proper controller methods `generatePitch()` and `getPitch()`
- **Impact:** Related API endpoints would fail

### 7. Service Export Issues
**File:** `pitchcraft-ai/services/supabaseService.js`
- **Bug:** Didn't export the supabase client itself, causing import failures in middleware
- **Fix:** Added `supabase` to module exports
- **Impact:** Auth middleware couldn't access Supabase client

### 8. Error Handling Middleware Placement
**File:** `pitchcraft-ai/server.js`
- **Bug:** Error handling middleware was placed before routes instead of after
- **Fix:** Moved error handling middleware to after all routes
- **Impact:** Route errors wouldn't be caught by error handler

### 9. Missing CORS Configuration
**File:** `pitchcraft-ai/server.js`
- **Bug:** No CORS middleware configured for cross-origin requests
- **Fix:** Added `cors` dependency and middleware
- **Impact:** Frontend wouldn't be able to communicate with backend

### 10. Problematic Frontend Dependency
**File:** `pitchcraft-frontend/package.json`
- **Bug:** `magic-ui@^0.1.0` dependency caused ODBC compilation errors
- **Fix:** Removed problematic dependency that was causing native compilation issues
- **Impact:** Frontend couldn't install dependencies

## Dependencies Added
- `cors@^2.8.5` - for handling cross-origin requests
- `nodemon@^3.0.0` - for development hot reloading

## Dependencies Fixed
- Downgraded `node-fetch` from v3.3.2 to v2.7.0 for CommonJS compatibility
- Removed `magic-ui` to resolve ODBC compilation issues

## Verification Results
✅ Backend syntax check: PASSED  
✅ Frontend syntax check: PASSED  
✅ Dependencies install: BOTH PROJECTS  
✅ Auth API compatibility: UPDATED  
✅ Route organization: FIXED  

## Remaining Notes
- All deprecated Supabase methods have been updated to v2 API
- Error handling is now properly configured
- Route organization follows best practices
- Both frontend and backend can now install dependencies successfully
- Authentication flow should work with proper environment variables configured

The application should now run without the critical bugs that were preventing startup and authentication.
